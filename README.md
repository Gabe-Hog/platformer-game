# SFML Platformer

A small 2D platformer game, that was developed using C++ and the game library SFML. This project was created as a final assignment in the course "Object Oriented Programming with C++" from the university "Blekinge Institue Of Technology", therefore there were some limiting factors. Hopefully I will be able to expand it and make it into a proper boss rush game.
